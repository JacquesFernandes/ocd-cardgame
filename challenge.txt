    Deck of Cards: a web app for people with OCD.

    A User logs into the app. On the page, you display the 52 cards in a standard playing cards deck ‘scattered’ on the screen. 

    At the bottom of the screen, have four ‘card holders’ - each labeled after a house of cards - spade, diamond, clubs, hearts. 

    The user can ‘clean up’ the space by dragging a card and dropping it into the right card holder. 

    Notes:

       - You can only place a card in the correct cardholder. Spades in spades, hearts in hearts, etc.

       - If all cards are put into the right cardholder, show a “restart” button. If clicked, the cards should be again shuffled in the space above.

       - If user logs out, save the progress they made. On second login, game should start from where they left off.

       - Don’t worry about UI design too much - for the cards, just make simple divs with card type and number on it.

       - You can use any library you want for drag and drop.

       - As far as possible, use MERN stack. If you feel really strongly that you are not comfortable with any part of this stack, you may choose to switch to another technology.

       - Submit your code with: 

        A git repository.
        A readme file with instructions on how to use the app.


    Your work will be judged on functionality, quality (including efficiency, organization and readability) and flair.
